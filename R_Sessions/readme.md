# Working with R

R can be a challenge to learn, especially if you've never worked in any programming languages in the past. I've linked some references [here](../main/R_Sessions/References) and below to help you practice and some cheat sheets to help you remember bits of code.

* [Tips for data visualization](../main/R_Sessions/References)
* [Color names in R](../main/R_Sessions/References)

The datasets used can be found here[../main/R_Sessions/Data]. The code for each session is as follows:

* Introduction to R {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/practice_day1.R)} 
* Basic Commands in R {[code_1](../main/R_Sessions/Code/practice.R)} {[code_2](../main/R_Sessions/Code/practice_day2.R)} {[code_3](../main/R_Sessions/Code/practice_day3.R)}
* Data Preparation (self-guided {[pdf](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet1.pdf)} {[html](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet1.html)})
* Exploratory Analysis (self-guided {[pdf](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet2.pdf)} {[html](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet2.html)}) {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/plots.R)}
* Tidyverse {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/plots.R)}
* Visualization & Plotting with ggplot2 {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/plots.R)}
* Mapping {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/mapping.R)}
* Time Series & Forecasting {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/forecasting.R)}

You will need to install the following packages:
