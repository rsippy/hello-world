# Working with R

R can be a challenge to learn, especially if you've never worked in any programming languages in the past. I've linked some references [here](../main/R_Sessions/References) and below to help you practice and some cheat sheets to help you remember bits of code.

* [Tips for data visualization](../main/R_Sessions/References)
* [Color names in R](../main/R_Sessions/References/Rcolor.pdf)
* [The Epidemiologist R Handbook](https://appliedepi.org/epirhandbook/): nearly everything an epidemiologist might want to do in R
* [Forecasting Principles & Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/intro.html): an excellent resource to learn more about forecasting theory with code

The datasets used can be found [here](../main/R_Sessions/Data). There are some slides related to these topics; these can be found in the slides for the main sessions [here](../main/R_Sessions/Slides). The code for each session is as follows:

* Introduction to R {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/practice_day1.R)} 
* Basic Commands in R {[code_1](../main/R_Sessions/Code/practice.R)} {[code_2](../main/R_Sessions/Code/practice_day2.R)}
* Data Preparation (self-guided {[pdf](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet1.pdf)} {[html](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet1.html)} {[solutions](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet1_sol.html)})
* Exploratory Analysis (self-guided {[pdf](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet2.pdf)} {[html](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet2.html)} {[solutions](../main/R_Sessions/worksheet2_sol.html)}) 
* Tidyverse {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/tidyverse.R)}
* Visualization & Plotting with ggplot2 {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/plots.R)}
* Mapping {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/mapping.R)}
* Time Series & Forecasting {[code](../main/R_Sessions/Code/forecasting.R)}

You will need to install the following packages:
- colorist, RColorBrewer, haven, xlsx, tidyverse, reshape2, ggplot2, datasets, sf, maps, data.table, viridis, scales, forecast, surveillance, slider, feasts
- *install.packages(c("colorist", "RColorBrewer", "haven", "xlsx", "tidyverse", "reshape2", "ggplot2", "datasets", "sf", "maps", "data.table", "viridis", "scales", "forecast", "surveillance", "slider", "feasts"))*
